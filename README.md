# Online_tutorials
This will be a comprehensive list of online tutorials that I have implemented. The focus will be on machine learning projects and ROS1 and ROS2 projects.

# Machine Learning Projects
1. [Wine Quality Prediction – LogisticRegression, SVC, XGBClassifier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wine-quality-prediction-machine-learning/)

2. [Wine Type Prediction - Keras](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prediction-of-wine-type-using-deep-learning/)

3. [Rainfall Prediction – LogisticRegression, SVC, XGBClassifier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rainfall-prediction-using-machine-learning-python/)

4. [Microsoft Stock Prediction – Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microsoft-stock-price-prediction-with-machine-learning/)
